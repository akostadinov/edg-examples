How to run examples:
====================

Endpoint examples show HotRod, REST and MemCached endpoints connecting to Enterprise Data Grid (EDG)
remotely and storing, retrieving and removing data from caches. All of the apps are variations of a simple 
Football Manager which is a console application. It is possible to add a team, players, remove 
all the entities and show the listing of all teams/players. Nothing complex, just showing basic 
operations with the cache.

Building and starting the application:
--------------------------------------

1) Add the following cache definitions into infinispan-subsystem in 
   ${EDG_HOME}/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml file:
   
   <local-cache name="memcachedCache" start="EAGER" batching="false" indexing="NONE">
       <locking isolation="REPEATABLE_READ" striping="false" acquire-timeout="20000" concurrency-level="500"/>
   </local-cache>
   <local-cache name="teams" start="EAGER" batching="false" indexing="NONE">
       <locking isolation="REPEATABLE_READ" striping="false" acquire-timeout="20000" concurrency-level="500"/>
   </local-cache>

NOTE: The cache called "teams" will be used by HotRod and REST endpoints; Memcached endpoint works with "memcachedCache" by
      default

2) Each of the submodules (hotrod-endpoint, rest-endpoint, memcached-endpoint) contains a configuration file 
   (src/main/resources/edg.properties). Modify it to point to your EDG installation (default values should be fine
   for most cases)

3) Build the applications by running this command:

    mvn package assembly:single

NOTE: This will bundle all dependencies into one jar file and so running the application is easier. You can also use
      just "mvn clean package" but running the application will need specifying all dependencies on the classpath.

4) Start your EDG server instance:

    ${EDG_HOME}/bin/standalone.sh

5) Run the example application in its directory:

- for hotrod-endpoint: 

    java -cp target/hotrod-endpoint-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.redhat.datagrid.hotrod.FootballManager

- for rest-endpoint:

    java -cp target/rest-endpoint-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.redhat.datagrid.rest.FootballManager

- for memcached-endpoint:

    java -cp target/memcached-endpoint-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.redhat.datagrid.memcached.FootballManager


Using the application:
----------------------
Basic usage scenerios can look like this (keyboard shortcuts will be shown to you upon start):

1) add a team
2) add players to the team
3) print all teams and their players
4) remove a player from certain team
5) print again
6) remove a team
7) print again
